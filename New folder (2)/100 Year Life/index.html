                In today’s world Scientists are involved with researching and invent more advance medicines for time
                long. Advance treatment procedure also includes organ replacement therapy. Beside all these advancement,
                there is no way of people’s health challenges &amp; suffering. Rather we can notice people to suffer
                with multi organ disfuctioning and unpleasant &amp; Never ending &amp; non curable diseases.

                    Statistics given by the World Health Organization (WHO) scientist on the ratio of death from heart
                    diseases like heart attack, heart blockage, high blood pressure etc is increasing. Apart from this,
                    the risk of Diabetes, Kidney failure, thyroid, Hormonal disorder, PCOD/PCOS are rising high. Lower
                    immunity is such threatening that people fail to resists any viral infection or any contagious
                    diseases, as a result of that health weakness, during corona pandemic we have seen the horrible
                    &amp; uncontrollable situation in medical system &amp; support.

                                    I am intended to bring back the lost heritage of Indian Ayurveda to improve the
                                    healing process and treat from complicated ailments. I spent my whole childhood in a
                                    village that kept me close to the nature while I got to know about different herbs
                                    &amp; plants and their medicinal benefits. I got so many opportunities to study
                                    nature science also have attended many seminars &amp; conventions to practice
                                    Ayurveda &amp; Nature Science. With all of my study, knowledge &amp; experiment,
                                    research &amp; findings, I am aiming to make a healthy and wise society to transform
                                    Indian citizen to better healthyzen. My intensive studies on Indian Ayurveda help me
                                    to know that only by living a holistic life, we can avoid 5000 type of diseases.

                                    It is found that surprisingly right foods can make wonder to our body, starting from
                                    providing right nourishment to protecting from any diseases. Further studies on
                                    maintaining health using natural process brought me about the concept of Blue zone,
                                    where people live more than 100 years without any complex diseases like BP,
                                    Diabetes, Heart diseases, Liver disorder, Kidney failure, cancer, PCOD &amp; PCOS
                                    etc. Even they are able to keep themselves away from doctors. In addition to that,
                                    there are 48 millions of animal other than human being living in this earth, even
                                    they are not dependent on doctors &amp; hospitals rather they meet all their need
                                    from Mother Nature.All these studies help me to understand the root cause of all
                                    diseases, are wrong food choices &amp; undigested waste material deposited within
                                    the digestive track &amp; colon. According to Ayurveda, undigested food &amp; waste
                                    material aggresses VATA (air). This aggravated vata when mixed with PITTA (Fire)
                                    &amp; KAPHA (Water), create imbalance of elements within the body &amp; this
                                    situation creates different types of medical diseases. Continuous deposition of
                                    waste &amp; undigested food materials with in the body creates harm to the mucus
                                    membrane presence in blood vessel &amp; other organs. These destroyed mucus membrane
                                    deposited as Ama and pass through blood within different organs like poison. Thus my
                                    moto is to spread the awareness on my findings that “food is medicine &amp; medicine
                                    is only food”. I want to unfold the best and proven natural remedy for all the
                                    chronic disease with the help of my knowledge &amp; use holistic approach.
